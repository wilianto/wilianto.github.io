Hello! I'm Wili, a software engineer. 

This blog is my digital diary, where I dive into topics like distributed systems, databases, Linux, and scalability. I jot down insights and discoveries that capture my curiosity and fuel my learning journey.

Once in a while, I might toss in some non-tech stuff too.

Cheers!
